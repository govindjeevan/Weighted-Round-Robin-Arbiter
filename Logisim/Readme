___________________________________________

The inputs are the Request pins.

High means, that port is requesting for the resource. (Such as RAM)
The Grant pins are the outputs.
If a grant pin is high, it means, that port it being allocated
the resource by the arbiter at that moment.

Each port maybe a CPU, GPU or any component that competes for a resource such as memory.


When there are multiple requests for the same resource, the round robin arbiter allocates the resource for each of the requests for a specific period of time, in order.

The Arbiter goes back to the first served request when all the requests have been granted once.

_____________________________________________________________________


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Set any combination of active reqests on the input side.
2. Enable simulation, ticks enabled.
3. Request ports can be activated and deactivated during the process.

The output side will show the round robin scheme or arbitration and seven-segmented displays the currently granted request index.
